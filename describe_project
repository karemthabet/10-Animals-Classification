# 🐾 10 Animals Image Classification using CNN

This project presents a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based image classification system designed to accurately identify and classify images into one of 10 animal categories. It demonstrates a complete deep learning pipeline from data preprocessing, model design, training, evaluation, and inference.

## 🧠 Project Objectives
- Build a robust image classification model using CNN.
- Train the model on a dataset of 10 different animal species.
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy and loss curves.
- Visualize predictions and interpret model outputs.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset contains images of 10 animal classes. It is structured in training and validation sets and includes various animal categories (e.g., cat, dog, horse, elephant, etc.).

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV / PIL
- NumPy, Matplotlib
