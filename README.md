#  Animals Classification

##  Introduction  
The Animal Classifier is a smart image-based application designed to recognize and classify different animal species using artificial intelligence and image processing techniques. It is ideal for educational projects, AI learners, and anyone interested in computer vision applications.

## Project Objectives  
- Develop a functional animal classification system using AI.  
- Implement image processing to enhance image quality and accuracy.  
- Create an intuitive interface for users to interact with the model.  
- Demonstrate how machine learning can be applied in real-world visual recognition.  
- Provide a base project that can be expanded with more classes or advanced features.
